# Build a method #bubble_sort that takes an array and returns a sorted array.
# It must use the bubble sort methodology (using #sort would be pretty pointless,
# wouldnâ€™t it?).

# I will need to loop through the array and switch two elements when element1
# is greater than element2. I will need to do this repeatedly inside a loop
# until there are no more switches on a pass through the array. Potential edge
# cases - single value array, all values are the same, negative numbers
